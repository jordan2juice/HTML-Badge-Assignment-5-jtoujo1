# Instructions  

## Introduction

Now it's time to use all the skills we learned so far to make a website.

It won't look like much, but when we learn CSS and Bootstrap, we will be able to make it look great! For now, focus on structure.

## Requirements

You must use the following tags.

* h1
* h2
* p
* a (with href attribute)
* img (with src attribute)
* table
* tr
* td
* (And use th thead tbody tfoot if you can for full points!)

## Detailed instructions

Take a look at the wireframe we did in class. (link to the wireframe will be in Google Classroom.) Your job will be to recreate it to the best of your ability. 

1. Your website will need three pages. Home, About, and Menu.
2. The pages should all have links to each other.
3. Each page should have a photo relevant to the topic.
4. Each page should have h1, h2 and p tags.
5. At least one page should have a table with at least 12 cells.
6. At least one page should have a list.
7. Research an include a `footer` tag at the bottom of each page. (For example: this can include your &copy; )


*Room for creativity*: You may change the topic, name, or text to something that sparks your interest. You may also make other changes as you see fit as you work. But, the design is there to give you an idea of what the final project should look like, approximately. 

For example, if you don't want to sell food, you can change the page from Menu to something else.

(Just be sure to use all the tags, and include links, images, lists, and a table.)
